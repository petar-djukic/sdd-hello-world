title: SDD Hello World Specifications

overview: |
  SDD Hello World is a minimal test fixture for cobbler-scaffold. The project
  has no PRDs, use cases, or test suites of its own — its purpose is to provide
  a stable, minimal Go module that cobbler-scaffold's end-to-end tests can
  scaffold against and exercise. For goals and boundaries see VISION.yaml. For
  components and structure see ARCHITECTURE.yaml.

coverage_gaps: |
  This project has no formal PRDs or use cases by design. Its specification
  is the VISION.yaml success criteria: the binary builds, prints "Hello, World!",
  and the scaffold targets operate correctly. Formal specs are unnecessary for
  a test fixture whose complexity is bounded.
