title: SDD Hello World Specifications

overview: |
  SDD Hello World is a minimal test fixture for cobbler-scaffold. The project
  specifies a Go binary that prints "Hello, World!" and exits 0. The
  cobbler-scaffold generation pipeline reads the PRD and produces the Go source
  files. For goals and boundaries see VISION.yaml. For components and structure
  see ARCHITECTURE.yaml.

    why_required: |
      The use case exercises all PRD requirements by building and running the
      binary, verifying output, exit code, and file structure.
    coverage: R1.1, R1.2, R1.3, R2.1, R2.2, R2.3

coverage_gaps: |
  No coverage gaps. All prd001-hello-world-binary requirements are covered by
  the rel02.0-uc001-build-hello-world use case and its test suite.
