  - Go source files cmd/sdd-hello-world/main.go and cmd/sdd-hello-world/version.go exist in the repository.
  - The go.mod file declares the module path github.com/petar-djukic/sdd-hello-world with no external dependencies.

test_cases:
  - name: Build succeeds
    inputs: |
      Run go build ./cmd/sdd-hello-world from the repository root.
    expected: |
      The command exits with code 0 and produces a compiled binary.

  - name: Binary prints greeting
    inputs: |
      Run the compiled sdd-hello-world binary with no arguments.

      Stdout contains exactly "Hello, World!" followed by a newline. No other
      output is produced.

  - name: Binary exits with code 0
    inputs: |
      Run the compiled sdd-hello-world binary and capture the exit code.

  - name: Version constant exists
    inputs: |
      Inspect cmd/sdd-hello-world/version.go for a Version constant.
    expected: |
      The file declares a package-level constant named Version of type string.

  - name: No external dependencies
