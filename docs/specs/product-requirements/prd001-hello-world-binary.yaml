title: Hello World Binary

problem: |
  The cobbler-scaffold orchestrator needs a minimal Go binary to exercise its
  measure and stitch pipeline against. The binary must be simple enough that a
  single generation cycle can produce it from specifications alone, yet
  complete enough to validate that the pipeline creates compilable, runnable
  Go code. Without a PRD that specifies the binary's requirements, the measure
  agent has no anchored requirements to propose and proposes zero tasks.

goals:
  - id: G1
    text: |
      Provide a compilable Go binary that prints a greeting and exits
      successfully, serving as a reproducible target for cobbler-scaffold
      code generation.
  - id: G2
    text: |
      Specify the binary precisely enough that the measure agent can propose
      implementation tasks anchored to numbered requirements.

requirements:
  R1:
    title: Binary structure
    items:
      - R1.1: The binary must have its entry point at cmd/sdd-hello-world/main.go with a main function in package main.
      - R1.2: The binary must have a version file at cmd/sdd-hello-world/version.go that declares a Version constant of type string in package main.
      - R1.3: The binary must use only the Go standard library. The go.mod file must not declare any external dependencies.
  R2:
    title: Runtime behavior
    items:
      - R2.1: The binary must print exactly "Hello, World!" followed by a newline character to standard output.
      - R2.2: The binary must exit with code 0 after printing.
      - R2.3: The binary must accept no command-line arguments and produce no other output.

non_goals:
  - Reading input from stdin or files
  - Handling command-line flags or arguments
  - Using external packages or dependencies
  - Writing tests within this project (cobbler-scaffold's E2E suite provides coverage)

acceptance_criteria:
  - go build ./cmd/sdd-hello-world succeeds with exit code 0.
  - Running the compiled binary produces exactly "Hello, World!\n" on stdout and exits with code 0.
  - cmd/sdd-hello-world/main.go exists with a main function.
  - cmd/sdd-hello-world/version.go exists with a Version constant.
