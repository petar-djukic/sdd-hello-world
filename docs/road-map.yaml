title: SDD Hello World Roadmap

releases:
  - version: "01.0"
    name: Initial project and scaffold integration
    status: done
    description: |
      Minimal Go binary, SDD project structure, and cobbler-scaffold integration.
      Phase 1 delivered the binary and documentation. Phase 2 scaffolded the
      orchestrator mage targets, published the module to the Go module proxy,
      and validated the full cobbler-scaffold E2E pipeline.
    use_cases: []

  - version: "02.0"
    name: Hello world binary from specifications
    status: pending
    description: |
      We implement the hello world binary from its PRD specification. The
      generation pipeline reads prd001-hello-world-binary and produces the Go
      source files. This release validates that cobbler-scaffold can generate
      code from specs in a clean repository.
    use_cases:
      - id: rel02.0-uc001-build-hello-world
        status: pending

prioritization:
  - Release 02.0 implements the binary from specifications so the generation pipeline has reproducible work to propose and execute.
