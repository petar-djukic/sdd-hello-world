title: SDD Hello World

executive_summary: |
  We build a minimal Go command-line application that prints "Hello, World!" to
  standard output and exits with code 0. The project exists as a test fixture
  for the cobbler-scaffold orchestrator. It validates that scaffold push,
  measure, stitch, and generator lifecycle targets work correctly against a
  real Go module published on the Go module proxy.

problem: |
  The cobbler-scaffold end-to-end tests need a stable, minimal Go project to
  scaffold and exercise mage targets against. Using a large, actively developed
  project like go-unix-utils couples test stability to ongoing spec changes.
  A dedicated test fixture isolates cobbler-scaffold validation from production
  project evolution.

what_this_does: |
  We provide the simplest possible Go binary (one file, zero external
  dependencies) wrapped in the SDD project structure. The project has a VISION
  document so cobbler's measure phase has a specification to read. The project
  is tagged and published as a Go module so PrepareTestRepo can download it
  via the Go module proxy.

why_we_build_this: |
  Cobbler-scaffold needs a test target that is small, stable, and exercises the
  full scaffolding pipeline. This project fills that role. It decouples test
  reliability from changes in go-unix-utils or crumbs.

success_criteria:
  build_correctness: |
    go build ./cmd/sdd-hello-world succeeds with exit code 0.
  runtime_correctness: |
    Binary prints exactly 'Hello, World!' followed by a newline and exits 0.
  scaffold_compatibility: |
    mage scaffold:push produces a working orchestrator setup; mage -l lists all targets.
  module_availability: |
    go list -m -versions returns at least one tagged version.

implementation_phases:
  - phase: "1"
    focus: Initial project
    deliverables: go.mod, main.go, VISION.yaml, LICENSE, README.md
  - phase: "2"
    focus: Scaffold integration
    deliverables: Scaffolded orchestrator files, configuration.yaml, tagged release

risks:
  - risk: Go module proxy caching delay
    impact: Low
    likelihood: Low
    mitigation: Wait for proxy propagation before running e2e tests

not: |
  We do not handle command-line arguments. We do not read input. We do not
  write to files. We do not use external packages. We do not write tests
  beyond what cobbler-scaffold's e2e suite provides. This is not a template
  for production SDD projects; it is a test fixture.
