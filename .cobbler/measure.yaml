          Use fmt.Println("Hello, World!") as the single statement in main(). This
          prints the exact string followed by a newline and returns, causing the
          process to exit with code 0. No other code is needed.

          Do not reference the Version constant from main(). The version.go file
          exists for the generation pipeline; main.go has no use for it. Keep the
          two files independent.

          The file should be minimal -- copyright header, package clause, import,
