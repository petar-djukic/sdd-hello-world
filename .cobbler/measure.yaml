  title: Implement hello world binary entry point (prd001 R1.1, R2.1, R2.2, R2.3)
  description: |-
    deliverable_type: code

    required_reading:
      - docs/specs/product-requirements/prd001-hello-world-binary.yaml (all requirements for the binary)
      - docs/ARCHITECTURE.yaml (Binary component description and project structure)
      - cmd/sdd-hello-world/version.go (existing file in the same package -- do not modify)
      - go.mod (module path -- do not modify or add dependencies)
      - docs/constitutions/go-style.yaml (copyright header and coding standards)
      - docs/constitutions/execution.yaml (execution rules -- do NOT run git commands)

    files:
      - path: cmd/sdd-hello-world/main.go
        action: create
        note: "Binary entry point: package main with main function that prints Hello, World! and exits 0"

      - id: R2
        text: "Print exactly \"Hello, World!\" followed by a newline character to standard output (prd001 R2.1)"
      - id: R3
        text: "Exit with code 0 after printing (prd001 R2.2)"

    design_decisions:
      - id: D1
        text: "Use fmt.Println(\"Hello, World!\") for output -- prints the string with a trailing newline, which satisfies R2.1 and R2.2 (main returns normally, Go exits 0)"
      - id: D2
        text: "Do not call os.Exit(0) explicitly -- Go exits with code 0 when main returns normally. An explicit os.Exit would be redundant."
      - id: D3
        text: "Do not reference the Version constant from version.go in main.go -- the PRD requires no output other than the greeting (prd001 R2.3)"
