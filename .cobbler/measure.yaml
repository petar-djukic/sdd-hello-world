  title: Create Hello World binary entry point (VISION runtime_correctness, build_correctness)
  description: |-
    deliverable_type: code

    required_reading:
      - docs/VISION.yaml (success_criteria section -- runtime_correctness and build_correctness)
      - docs/ARCHITECTURE.yaml (components section -- Binary component; project_structure section)
      - cmd/sdd-hello-world/version.go (current seed file that must be modified)

    files:
      - path: cmd/sdd-hello-world/main.go
        action: create
        note: Binary entry point -- prints "Hello, World!" to stdout and exits 0
      - path: cmd/sdd-hello-world/version.go
        action: modify
        note: Remove main() function and fmt import -- keep only the Version constant

    requirements:

          Create cmd/sdd-hello-world/main.go with a main() function that prints
          exactly "Hello, World!" followed by a newline to stdout and exits with
          code 0. Use fmt.Println. This satisfies VISION success_criteria
          runtime_correctness.

        text: |
          Modify cmd/sdd-hello-world/version.go to contain only the package
          declaration, copyright header, and the Version constant. Remove the
          main() function and the "fmt" import. The Version constant value must
          remain unchanged.

          The binary must use only the Go standard library. No external packages
          may be added to go.mod. This satisfies ARCHITECTURE design decision 1
          (zero-dependency binary).
      - id: R5
        text: |
          The binary must compile successfully with "go build ./cmd/sdd-hello-world".
          This satisfies VISION success_criteria build_correctness.

    design_decisions:
      - id: D1
        text: |
          Use only fmt.Println("Hello, World!") in main(). The VISION
          runtime_correctness criterion requires the binary to print exactly
          "Hello, World!" followed by a newline. fmt.Println provides the
          trailing newline.

        text: |
          The main() function belongs in main.go, not version.go. Per
          ARCHITECTURE project_structure, main.go is the "Binary entry point"
          and version.go is the "Version constant (seed file, populated at
          generation time)."
      - id: D3
        text: |
          Do not reference or print the Version constant from main(). The
          binary's sole behavior is printing "Hello, World!" per VISION. The
          Version constant exists for the orchestrator's use, not for runtime
          output.

          Running the compiled binary prints exactly "Hello, World!" followed
          by a newline to stdout and exits with code 0

          cmd/sdd-hello-world/version.go contains only the package declaration,
          copyright header, and "const Version" -- no func main(), no import
      - id: AC4
        text: |
          cmd/sdd-hello-world/main.go exists with func main() that calls
          fmt.Println("Hello, World!")
